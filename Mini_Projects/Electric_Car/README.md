# Mini-Project: Electric Car

The students should propose a real time adapting sound for almost noiseless modern electric cars (or other similar technologies that imply auditory displays)

It should incorporate details about its aesthetics, concept, logic and pertinence (safety, auditory displays) but also a possible Interface, Interaction and sound generator structure
