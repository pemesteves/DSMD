Projects made for the [Sound Design for Digital Media](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=456340) course (1st year of the FEUP's [Master in Multimedia](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=732&pv_ano_lectivo=2020)).

We worked on 4 different projects:
- Sound for *Tessa: The Huntress*, a game developed in collaboration with the [Computer Games Development](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=459506) course (4th year of the FEUP's [Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=742&pv_ano_lectivo=2020));
- 3D Soundscape, made for headphones and the 8 speaker layout configured at the FEUP's CSM Lab;
- A real-time adapting sound for almost noiseless modern electric cars;
- Emulation of a 4 syllables word using elements of concrete and/or synthetic sounds.

Across this repository, you can see the mentioned projects as our first work exploring Reaper, which inspired our 3D Soundscape.
